Overview of Grantmaking Guidelines  
VNA Foundation awards grants to support nonprofit organizations that provide home- and  
community-based health services to medically underserved populations. Priority will be given to  
organizations with operating budgets of $30,000,000 or less.

The majority of our grants are made to organizations serving Cook County. Organizations in  
McHenry, Kane and Will are also eligible for funding, if serving HRSA-designated medically  
underserved populations in Health Workforce Shortage Areas. Our extremely limited funds  
mean that, at present, we are generally unable to fund in Lake and DuPage counties except  
under special circumstances.

We will consider funding program, operating, and capital grants, including indirect costs and  
salaries that support core staff. Generally, only grant requests of $40,000 or more will be  
considered, unless smaller grants are required due to organization size or other identifiable  
factors. We prefer that the requested grant amounts be rounded to the nearest $500. For more  
information about our funding guidelines, visit our FAQ page.

We approve and disburse grants 4 times per year. See our Funding Overview page to learn  
about our funding priority areas.

Qualifications and Eligibility  
All grants requests must:

Have measurable goals and objectives. See our Outcome Measures page for examples.  
Benefit the medically underserved, uninsured populations, and/or Medicaid recipients.  
Be submitted by an organization exempt from income tax under sec. 501 (c)(3), and designated  
as a public charity under section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2), of the Internal Revenue Code. VNA  
Foundation does not provide grants to section 509(a)(3) ""supporting organizations."" As of fall  
2024, VNA Foundation also does not fund large hospital or university systems." |

organizations (NGOs) that address a signicant social problem. We're looking for programs that t  
within our investment areas, focus on the underserved, and use technology to improve the

impact of eligible organizations around the globe with national or multinational operations.  
Before applying, invited NPOs/NGOs can determine their eligibility by reviewing the  
requirements below and the grant giving policies. Organizational and programmatic  
requirements • Organizations within the United States must be recognized by the Internal  
Revenue Service (IRS) as tax exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and  
classied by the IRS as a public charity. © 2025 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 2 •  
Organizations from outside the United States must provide information and documents to  
determine whether the organization is the equivalent of a U.S. public charity. • Programs to be  
funded must serve an audience greater than 65 percent economically underserved relative to  
the average standards of the target geography. • Organizations and programs must focus on at  
least one of our social investment sectors: crisis response, education, economic empowerment,  
and/or climate impact and regeneration. • For education, crisis response, and economic  
empowerment proposals, we will also consider proposals that address environmental  
sustainability within the context of that investment area. For example, we would consider  
funding an economic empowerment program that specically focuses on creating green jobs. •  
An organization's overhead is not to exceed 25 percent. (Organizations are occasionally exempt  
from this requirement; however, they must be exceptionally aligned with Cisco's values and  
criteria, and they must clearly explain and justify their overhead costs. Exemptions to the  
requirement on overhead expenses are determined on a case-by-case basis.) Cisco Foundation  
does not tend to make grants to colleges and universities. In the case that such a grant may be  
made, Cisco Foundation does not support additional institutional overhead rates for colleges  
and universities. • The maximum request amount for rst-time grant recipients is US$75,000.

or sectarian organizations (Note: A direct service program run by a faith-based organization  
may be eligible. See our grant giving policies.) • Hospitals: private or public hospitals; hospital  
foundations; medical centers, research centers, etc. (Programs based in a hospital may be

Policy on the funding of equipment In general, Cisco does not fund the purchase of computer  
hardware or software but may consider doing so only in cases where: 1\) such resources are  
leveraged in a strategically innovative manner, thereby extending their impact well beyond  
everyday/sta use; and 2\) such resources are not available through other, more costeective means such as in-kind donation. Applicants must demonstrate that they have thoroughly  
explored such avenues without success. © 2025 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 4  
Policy on board review and approval Cisco requires applicants to certify that the chairperson or  
at least one ocer of the organization's board of directors has reviewed the grant proposal and  
that the organization's board is aware of the application and supports its submission. Cisco also  
requires applicants to certify the accuracy of the proposal and to conrm that the organization  
complies with the policies stated on this web site. Policy on reviews of accuracy/compliance All  
applicants are subject to reviews of their representations in their grant applications, their  
compliance with the policies stated above, and, if applicable, their adherence to the terms of the  
grant contract. If such a review reveals signicant inaccuracies or violations of the policies stated  
above, or if an organization does not cooperate with the review, the organization may be  
required to return any granted assets and forfeit future funding eligibility. Written grant contract  
Grantee organizations are required to sign a donation agreement electronically before donations  
can be delivered. Reporting and performance tracking Cisco looks for grant proposals in which  
concrete measures of success can be used to assess performance. Organizations that receive  
funding will be required to use our online grant platform to customize performance metrics for  
their project and measure their progress over the life of the grant award. Meaningful  
participation in this process is a requirement for continued funding eligibility. Cisco grant giving  
policies In addition, organizations must adhere to Cisco policies related to nondiscrimination,  
religious proselytizing, nonsupport of violence and terrorism, advocacy, lobbying, and other  
political activities and other areas listed in grant giving policies. © 2025 Cisco and/or its

the quality of your grant application, we recommend that you carefully review the criteria we use  
to evaluate grants. Addresses a critical social challenge with unmet need The program  
addresses a problem that aects many lives within one of Cisco's investment areas, and which  
has severe eects on the lives of individuals and communities within the target area. A signicant  
unmet need exists due to a gap in funding or a need for innovative approaches. Incorporates  
metrics to measure program impact The program denes and utilizes SMART metrics (Specic,  
Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) to help Cisco and the grantee measure progress  
toward success. The highest priority and funding consideration are given to proposals that  
clearly articulate the planned result of their eorts, as well as the metrics to measure that result.  
Serves the underserved The target audience is greater than 65 percent economically  
underserved, relative to the average standards of the target geography. Makes innovative use of  
technology The program makes innovative use of information and communications technology  
to improve the eciency and reach of program services. Employs an innovative approach with  
potential for broad impact The program provides an innovative solution that creates an  
opportunity for signicant reach beyond the direct benets of specic Cisco-funded activities. For  
example: © 2025 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 6 • Market eects due to major  
shift in economics, productivity, or eectiveness • Ability to catalyze behavior of other key agents  
or partners in ecosystem to achieve an order of magnitude more together than apart Is designed  
to be replicable, scalable, and sustainable The design of the program allows it to be easily and  
cost-eectively replicated in communities around the globe and to meet the needs of the target  
population without a nearly equivalent investment for each individual or group. The long-term  
plan for the program enables it to ourish signicantly beyond the resources provided by Cisco.  
Possesses outstanding leadership The organization has an outstanding leader or management  
team with qualities such as vision, execution ability, passion, ethical approach, expertise,  
external relationships, and a credible track record in the relevant area. Application process

include all cost-share including in-kind contributions, funding from other sources, cash  
from applicant, and HumanitiesAR grant request. The budget explanation should  
expand on the budget summary and match all cost-share and grant-requested amounts  
shown.  
Important Note: HumanitiesAR provides fillable PDF forms for budget summaries and  
narratives across all federal assistance Grants processes. You must use these forms  
when applying for grants. If you don't submit them, you may be asked to provide the  
proper paperwork or be denied due to non-compliance.  
Budget Summary  
The budget summary is a fillable form that states cash and in-kind cost-share  
contributions, as well as grant amount requested from HumanitiesAR. The totals for  
each of these items should match and add up to what is written in the budget  
explanation.  
Budget Explanation  
The budget explanation will include an itemized explanation of the totals listed in the  
budget summary, as well as a justification for the funds you're requesting from  
HumanitiesAR.  
When federal or state rates aren't applicable, you must submit documentation to  
corroborate the amounts included in the budget. A few common examples of expenses  
that require documentation include supplies, books, printing, hotel rates, airfare, facility  
rentals, or contracted companies. The documentation should be itemized, accounting  
for items to be purchased, item price, and the number of items.  
Cost Share  
Cost-sharing (or matching) means that a portion of a project's cost is not funded by  
federal funds. For Major and Mini Grants, cost-sharing is 50/50. This means  
HumanitiesAR grant funds may not account for more than half of the project's total cost.  
●​ You can use any combination of cash cost-share or in-kind cost-share, but all  
funds must be secured at the time of application.  
●​ Cost-share may include cash from applicant, in-kind, and cash from other  
sources. Those other sources may be private, corporate, or government  
awards and/or donations (local, state, and/or federal). Grants received from  
other entities for the same project may be used as cost-share, but may not be  
used for identical expenses of the project.  
●​ In-kind cost-share is the cash value of services, goods, and space donated to  
the project by third parties.  
●​ All cost-share and expenses for a project must occur during the proposed  
grant period. Applicants may use any combination of cash cost-share and  
in-kind cost-share to meet grant application requirements.  
●​ All cost-share, including registration fees, donations, grants, and funds, must  
be secured at the time of grant application submission.  
●​ Unsecured registration fees, grants, and donations may not be used for  
cost-share.  
●​ Grants that require cost-share:  
○​ Major Grants  
○​ Mini Grants  
Examples of Common Expenses  
●​ Travel  
○​ Mileage reimbursement  
■​ Must include the person(s) name to receive  
reimbursement, the purpose of the trip, the from and to  
locations, total roundtrip miles, cost per mile  
(HumanitiesAR will pay up to the current government rate  
per mile), and total amount.  
○​ Airfare  
■​ Must include the from and to locations, the purpose of the  
trip, name of the traveler, and cost of airfare for each  
person to receive reimbursement.  
○​ Hotel accommodations  
■​ Must provide the name(s) of the individual, number of  
nights, rate per night, and total amount.  
■​ Applicants are encouraged to seek reasonable rates  
○​ Personnel Costs  
■​ Salary and wage expenditures  
■​ May include the services of the project director,  
staff of the applicant organization, and other  
salaried or hourly wage participants.  
■​ Salary and wage expenditures should not include  
services provided as a part of regularly assigned  
duties.  
■​ The basis for salaries, wages, and fringe benefits  
must be explained in the Budget Narrative.  
■​ Honoraria  
■​ Organizations requesting funds for speaker fees  
and/or honoraria will be allowed up to a  
maximum of $1,000 per speaker. The fact that a  
speaker is widely recognized and considered to  
be important is not in and of itself justification for  
an increase in the honoraria for a single event.  
The total cost for multiple speakers will not  
exceed $5,000 per proposal.  
●​ Supplies and Materials  
○​ Must include unit, unit cost, number of units, and shipping costs if  
applicable for each item  
●​ Printing  
○​ When requesting funds for printing costs, the cost may not exceed  
25% of the proposal's overall budget.  
○​ Must include quotes for price of printing in the Budget Narrative.  
●​ Equipment Rental or Purchase  
○​ Up to $1,000 in grant funds may be applied to the purchase of  
equipment with useful lives longer than the proposed grant period,  
such as a camera, tape recorder, computer, printer, and/or similar  
device. Justification for the purchase or rental of equipment must  
accompany the grant application and be included in the Budget  
Narrative.  
○​ The applicant must show that the purchase price is less than the  
rental price of the items for the length of the proposed grant period.  
○​ The applicant should explain the plan for use of purchased  
equipment after the project is completed.  
For more information about eligible/ineligible expenses, feel free to contact us.  
Sample Grant Budget Summary and Explanation  
In the fictional example—provided here for demonstration purposes only—the applicant,  
Ms. Suzie Teacher, is applying for a grant to host a professional development  
symposium in Little Rock. Suzie will bring in three speakers and supply their books to  
symposium attendees. She is requesting funds to pay honoraria to the speakers,  
reimburse mileage for their trips to Little Rock, and purchase the books to distribute at  
the event.  
This example demonstrates how to fill out budget forms to satisfy our requirements. As  
a reminder, you must submit all budget summaries and explanations using our fillable  
PDF forms (seen in this example). If you don't use these forms, you may be asked to  
resubmit with the proper paperwork or be denied due to noncompliance.  
NOTE: This example includes the use of cost-share. If you're applying for a grant that  
doesn't have a cost-share requirement, you can still follow this same example but leave  
blank the ""Cash from Applicant"" and ""In-Kind"" sections." |

This document provides an overview of the Community Foundation for the Greater Capital Region for: • Grantees and other applicants seeking financial and/or other support; • Nonprofit organizations, public and governmental entities, as well as business and community groups seeking to form partnerships with the Community Foundation; • The general public, business community, press and other media seeking information about the nature and scope of the Community Foundation’s activities. Links to online applications and more detailed guidelines for each specific fund are available online at www.cfgcr.org/upcominggrantdeadlines.php. MISSION The mission of the Community Foundation for the Greater Capital Region is to strengthen our community through philanthropy. The Foundation accomplishes this in collaboration with donors and community partners who share our vision for community transformation through stewardship of charitable endowments, superior donor services, effective grantmaking and leadership to address community needs. ABOUT THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION The Community Foundation helps promote philanthropy in our region by matching individuals, families and organizations with the issues they care about and providing them with efficient and effective giving strategies. Our donors are as diverse as our community and come to the Community Foundation for many different reasons. They are united by a desire to be part of creating a brighter future for the greater Capital Region. The Community Foundation manages more than 460 funds which are allocated to meet donors’ philanthropic goals and the changing needs in our community. These charitable funds have granted over $100 million since the Foundation’s creation in 1968\. Often, multiple funds or donors join together to make grants with greater impact than one donor could make alone. All assets are collectively invested, offering donors access to investment strategies and management normally available only to large investors, allowing them to achieve maximum returns. The majority of grants made by the Community Foundation each year are in partnership with individuals, families and organizations who ask the Foundation to facilitate their giving. Many of our donors enjoy the flexibility of donor advised funds, which allow them to recommend grants to support specific charitable organizations or causes. Several of our funds have chosen to solicit applications for grants. These funds are among those described in this publication. The Foundation also manages several funds that allow discretion to make grants that fund innovative, creative projects and programs that are responsive to changing community needs. These funds, our “Community Impact Funds,” are either Discretionary Funds, which allow the Foundation the flexibility to use its extensive knowledge of community issues and organizations to make grants that address emerging issues; or Field of Interest Funds, which give the Foundation grantmaking discretion within given areas of interest. With these Community Impact Funds, the Foundation utilizes the expertise of its staff and Board of Directors to identify opportunities to make grants that will have the most impact in the community. Community Impact Funds are described on page 5 of this document. 4 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR GRANT APPLICATIONS To be eligible for competitive grants, applicants must meet the following requirements: • Qualify under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as a nonprofit organization OR operate under the fiscal sponsorship of a qualifying nonprofit organization; • Serve residents and be located within the ten-county Capital Region of New York State (Albany, Columbia, Fulton, Greene, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, and Washington Counties) unless otherwise indicated.

## **Project Description**

The project description provides the “who, what, when, where, and why” of the proposed project. Clearly and concisely explain what will occur during the proposed grant period, how will funds be used, and the roles of project participants.

## **Budget Summary and Explanation**

Your grant application will include a summary and narrative of the project budget that shows the project’s expected expenses and cost-sharing (if applicable). Be sure to include all cost-share including in-kind contributions, funding from other sources, cash from applicant, and HumanitiesAR grant request. The budget explanation should expand on the budget summary and match all cost-share and grant-requested amounts shown.

Important Note: HumanitiesAR provides fillable PDF forms for budget summaries and narratives across all federal assistance Grants processes. You must use these forms when applying for grants. If you don’t submit them, you may be asked to provide the proper paperwork or be denied due to non-compliance.

### Budget Summary

The budget summary is a fillable form that states cash and in-kind cost-share contributions, as well as grant amount requested from HumanitiesAR. The totals for each of these items should match and add up to what is written in the budget explanation.

### Budget Explanation

The budget explanation will include an itemized explanation of the totals listed in the budget summary, as well as a justification for the funds you’re requesting from HumanitiesAR.

When federal or state rates aren’t applicable, you must submit documentation to corroborate the amounts included in the budget. A few common examples of expenses that require documentation include supplies, books, printing, hotel rates, airfare, facility rentals, or contracted companies. The documentation should be itemized, accounting for items to be purchased, item price, and the number of items.

### Cost Share

Cost-sharing (or matching) means that a portion of a project’s cost is not funded by federal funds. For  Major and Mini Grants, cost-sharing is 50/50. This means HumanitiesAR grant funds may not account for more than half of the project’s total cost.

* You can use any combination of cash cost-share or in-kind cost-share, but all funds must be secured at the time of application.  
* Cost-share may include cash from applicant, in-kind, and cash from other sources. Those other sources may be private, corporate, or government awards and/or donations (local, state, and/or federal). Grants received from other entities for the same project may be used as cost-share, but may not be used for identical expenses of the project.  
* In-kind cost-share is the cash value of services, goods, and space donated to the project by third parties.  
* All cost-share and expenses for a project must occur during the proposed grant period. Applicants may use any combination of cash cost-share and in-kind cost-share to meet grant application requirements.  
* All cost-share, including registration fees, donations, grants, and funds, must be secured at the time of grant application submission.  
* Unsecured registration fees, grants, and donations may not be used for cost-share.  
* Grants that require cost-share:  
  * Major Grants  
  * Mini Grants

### Examples of Common Expenses

* Travel  
  * Mileage reimbursement  
    * Must include the person(s) name to receive reimbursement, the purpose of the trip, the from and to locations, total roundtrip miles, cost per mile (HumanitiesAR will pay up to the current government rate per mile), and total amount.  
  * Airfare  
    * Must include the from and to locations, the purpose of the trip, name of the traveler, and cost of airfare for each person to receive reimbursement.  
  * Hotel accommodations  
    * Must provide the name(s) of the individual, number of nights, rate per night, and total amount.  
    * Applicants are encouraged to seek reasonable rates  
  * Personnel Costs

      * May include the services of the project director, staff of the applicant organization, and other salaried or hourly wage participants.  
      * Salary and wage expenditures should not include services provided as a part of regularly assigned duties.  
      * The basis for salaries, wages, and fringe benefits must be explained in the Budget Narrative.  
    * Honoraria  
      * Organizations requesting funds for speaker fees and/or honoraria will be allowed up to a maximum of $1,000 per speaker. The fact that a speaker is widely recognized and considered to be important is not in and of itself justification for an increase in the honoraria for a single event. The total cost for multiple speakers will not exceed $5,000 per proposal.  
* Supplies and Materials  
  * Must include unit, unit cost, number of units, and shipping costs if applicable for each item  
* Printing  
  * When requesting funds for printing costs, the cost may not exceed 25% of the proposal’s overall budget.  
  * Must include quotes for price of printing in the Budget Narrative.  
* Equipment Rental or Purchase  
  * Up to $1,000 in grant funds may be applied to the purchase of equipment with useful lives longer than the proposed grant period, such as a camera, tape recorder, computer, printer, and/or similar device. Justification for the purchase or rental of equipment must accompany the grant application and be included in the Budget Narrative.  
  * The applicant must show that the purchase price is less than the rental price of the items for the length of the proposed grant period.  
  * The applicant should explain the plan for use of purchased equipment after the project is completed.

*For more information about eligible/ineligible expenses, feel free to [contact us](https://humanitiesar.org/about-us/contact/).*

### Sample Grant Budget Summary and Explanation

In the fictional example—provided here for demonstration purposes only—the applicant, Ms. Suzie Teacher, is applying for a grant to host a professional development symposium in Little Rock. Suzie will bring in three speakers and supply their books to symposium attendees. She is requesting funds to pay honoraria to the speakers, reimburse mileage for their trips to Little Rock, and purchase the books to distribute at the event.

This example demonstrates how to fill out budget forms to satisfy our requirements. As a reminder, you must submit all budget summaries and explanations using our fillable PDF forms (seen in this example). If you don’t use these forms, you may be asked to resubmit with the proper paperwork or be denied due to noncompliance.

NOTE: This example includes the use of cost-share. If you’re applying for a grant that doesn’t have a cost-share requirement, you can still follow this same example but leave blank the “Cash from Applicant” and “In-Kind” sections.

Who Can Apply, and What Is Required?  
• In-state nonprofits are eligible, including public libraries and other cultural nonprofits that receive  
some county or city funding.  
• The primary audience for projects must be the out-of-school audience (the general public).  
• A determination letter of 501(c)(3) status is not required.  
• A Unique Entity ID (SAM) from SAM.gov for sub-awardees is required and must be set “public”  
for HK staff confirmation.  
(This 12-digit alphanumeric ID is used to track federal funding. A full SAM.gov registration is not  
required for HK grants; only the UEID number is required.)  
How to get a UEID? Follow the Quick Start Guide.  
• NOTE: Organizations with an open grant from a previous grant cycle are not eligible.  
Getting Started  
Applicants are encouraged to speak with HK staff early to discuss ideas or clarify guidelines. Email Leslie  
VonHolten, Director of Grants & Outreach, LVH@humanitieskansas.org.  
Deadline  
Applications can be submitted at any time, but must be at least 6 weeks before the first event.  
Submit a Draft (Optional)  
Applicants are strongly encouraged, but not required, to submit a draft. Prepare a draft by following the  
“Application Step-by-Step” below, which mirrors the online application. HK staff will provide feedback to  
make the project more competitive for final submission. Drafts should be emailed to  
LVH@humanitieskansas.org (Do not use the online grants form to submit a draft.)  
Successful Projects  
• Have humanities central to the project. History, literature, and cultural studies are humanities  
disciplines, as are philosophy, law, ethics, and art history.  
• Engage adult, out-of-school audiences. Events are designed for in-person discussions or  
through participatory online platforms.  
• Involve multiple ways to engage beyond one public event. For example, a request for a  
keynote speaker is usually not considered a competitive proposal unless there are additional  
engagement opportunities such as an exhibit, book discussions, film screening, etc.  
• Have a strong community partner. Projects with a community focus must formally partner with  
a nonprofit organization within that community. Ideally, the community organization will be the  
grant sponsor. At the very least, a letter of support from the partner organization is required.  
Humanities include the following disciplines:  
• History  
• Literature  
• Languages and cultures  
• Law  
• Folklore  
• Gender studies  
• Religious studies  
• Philosophy  
• Art history\*  
• Archeology  
• Cultural anthropology  
• Ethics  
• Social sciences, such as political science and sociology, are also considered humanities.  
\* A note regarding the arts: Humanities Kansas does not support arts projects, defined as  
creation and display of visual art, creative workshops, or performance (drama, dance, music,  
etc.). However, projects that focus on the analysis and contextualization of art, such as a panel  
discussion moderated by an art historian, are eligible. The difference between humanities and art  
can be a fine line. If the project includes arts components, contact HK staff for guidance. The  
Kansas Arts Commission is also a resource for arts grant funding.  
Grant Requirements  
Every HK grant proposal includes the following items: Two or more goals for the project, one or more  
humanities scholars, a project timeline, a marketing plan, and a budget.  
Goals  
Goals are simple statements that summarize what is hoped to be accomplished. For example, connect  
people with new information and points-of-view, spark discussion and new ideas, or strengthen  
relationships among groups or organizations.  
Humanities Scholar(s)  
Every project must involve at least one humanities scholar to apply the tools of the humanities and  
provide in-depth knowledge. HK staff can help identify humanities scholars. Scholars must have at least  
one of the following criteria:  
• At least a Master’s degree in a humanities discipline helpful to the success of the project  
• College-level teaching experience in a humanities discipline or proven record of scholarship in the  
humanities  
• Museum curator, librarian, or other individual with exceptional knowledge of the relevant topic  
• Culture bearers—tribal or community elders, or practitioners of traditional cultural forms  
The role of the Scholar: Before submitting the application, the project director and the scholar should  
discuss the project, formulate ways to strengthen the humanities aspects, and consider multiple  
perspectives. They can offer feedback about the humanities content and suggest additional resources.  
During the grant project, the scholar can  
• Serve as a speaker, panelist, or lead a discussion  
• Offer ongoing advice and guidance  
• Review an exhibition script or short film script for authenticity and multiple perspectives  
• Provide an assessment of the project at its conclusion  
Timeline / Plan of Action  
A monthly timeline lists the work required from planning stage to completion. This helps demonstrate an  
understanding of the work involved in a successful project.  
• Include a list of major project activities to be completed within 12 months  
• Assign a date to complete each task  
• Identify the key project staff and consider their role in accomplishing the activities.  
Communications / Marketing Plan  
The primary audience for all Action grants is the out-of-school public. How will the organization reach this  
audience with this project? What are the characteristics or demographics of the audience? Press  
releases submitted to local newspapers and use of social media are effective methods. (Publicity must  
not be released prior to the funding decision or without acknowledgement of Humanities Kansas.)  
Budget  
Grant applications are requests for funding, and the budget should not be left to the last minute. Show all  
anticipated expenses needed to accomplish the project. Provide details.  
Cost share: In addition to grant funds, applicants must contribute goods and services equal to or greater  
in value than the amount requested. This is called cost share and can include  
• Staff and volunteer time devoted to the project  
• Donated use of office space, venue facility, equipment, and supplies  
• Social media, public service announcements, and other free publicity  
• Refreshments at events  
Cash match is not required. HK only accepts costs accrued after the official start date of the grant period.  
Grant funds CAN be used for:  
• Salaries for temporary staff specifically hired to carry out the project  
• Salaries for part-time staff with significant roles in the project  
• Honoraria for scholars  
• In-state travel reimbursement for staff and scholars including mileage, meals, and lodging  
• Non-durable supplies and some equipment. Funds cannot be used exclusively for equipment  
purchases; however, a small portion of the grant request can be for equipment if it will enhance  
the overall goal of providing public humanities programming (cannot exceed 25% of the request)  
• Tools to support online programming, such as a Zoom license for virtual public events.  
• Rental of facilities or equipment such as projectors and audio systems  
• Some publicity and promotions (cannot exceed 25% of the request)  
• Funds in addition to the grant project can be requested to assist with increasing access to the  
project, including support for a sign language interpreter, Spanish language interpreter, audio  
tours for digital and in-person exhibits, rental of handicap accessible ramps, etc. (Accessibility  
funds are only available to enhance the humanities content as proposed in the project application.  
HK cannot fund projects that retroactively make existing humanities content accessible.)  
If something is not listed, contact staff for clarification.  
Grant funds CANNOT be used for:  
• Salaries for full-time staff employed by the sponsor organization  
• Film projects longer than 20 minutes in length. (Beginning in 2025, HK no longer supports longform or full-length film projects.)  
• Publishing a book or catalog  
• Performance pieces such as plays, musical performances, storytelling, or re-enactors  
• Purchase of major equipment, website hosting, or insurance  
• Purchase, restoration, or construction of a building  
• Salaries for students for a class, school project, internship, or work study. Students may be  
involved as volunteers and their time counted toward cost share.  
• Courses for academic credit or school projects  
• Academic conferences or programs directed to a single profession  
• Creation or purchase of a mural, memorial, monument, or plaque  
• Individual research, scholarships, or fellowships  
• Fundraisers, advocacy, or lobbying  
• Projects that discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, age, physical  
abilities, sexual orientation or identity  
• Food, beverages, entertainment, and promotional giveaways such as shirts or mugs  
• Introductory videos or films for museums and other institutions  
Humanities Kansas is supported by funds provided by the federal government through the National  
Endowment for the Humanities. Organizations receiving Humanities Kansas funding may not use the  
funds to:  
• Promote a particular political, religious, or ideological point of view;  
• Advocate for a particular program of social or political action; or  
• Support specific public policies or legislation.

BUDGET  
18\. Budget Form. Use the budget form to provide a clear description of all the anticipated expenses  
throughout the course of the project.  
Remember that applicants must provide cost share that is equal to or greater than the total grant  
amount requested.  
Cost share is a way to document local contributions. It is the goods and services contributed to the  
project by the sponsor organization (or other partners involved) that are not funded by the grant.  
Everything used or done in support of the project once the grant has been awarded has a value.  
These local contributions ensure that Humanities Kansas is able to meet its requirements to the  
National Endowment for the Humanities.  
Include detailed notes for each expense that explains how the amount was determined. Round totals  
to the nearest dollar. Provide details in the following categories. Reviewers expect a clear  
understanding of where funds are being allocated.  
• Project Staff  
• Honoraria  
• Travel  
• Promotion  
• Supplies  
• Equipment and Facilities  
• Other Expenses  
What Do These Budget Categories Mean?  
Project Staff is the value of time for people who administer the project, both paid and volunteer. Staff  
may include the project director, marketing coordinator, or specialty staff hired for the project. For  
each person, estimate the total hours dedicated to the project and multiply by a comparable wage.  
• Fiscal Officer’s services must be a cost share contribution  
• Grant writing or other activities prior to the grant award cannot be included  
• Volunteer time may be valued at $30/hr and should be listed as cost share  
• Fringe benefits may only be shown as cost share  
Honoraria are payments made to humanities scholars that serve in roles such as speakers,  
panelists, or consultants. Honoraria should be proportional to the work and qualifications of each  
scholar, and therefore ranges according to the time and expertise required. Consult with scholars to  
determine the appropriate amount. In general, honorarium is typically the following:  
• $250-$300 per speaking event  
• $500 for consulting a project and speaking at an event  
• Up to $65 per hour for research, consultation, and project content.  
Speakers not paid with grant funds should be listed as cost share.  
Travel includes mileage, lodging, and meals for both project staff and scholars. Only out-of-town  
travel can be funded by the grant. In-town travel must be counted as cost share. HK allowable rates:  
• Mileage: $0.67/mi for private vehicles. Rental cars with economy rates are allowed.  
• Lodging: Up to $135/night. Expenses beyond this rate must be cost share.  
• Meals: Up to $45/day  
• Airfare: Economy rate only  
Promotion includes the creation of brochures, invitations, flyers, posters, and costs associated with  
mailings. It may also include paid advertising such as online media, newspaper, radio, and television.  
The use of social media is encouraged. Promotions costs cannot exceed 25% of the grant request.  
Supplies include detailed material costs for aspects such as exhibits or book discussions, or  
production of program agendas and gallery brochures. This category may include estimated costs of  
expendable items or office supplies needed for the project, such as pens, paper, or printer ink.  
Equipment and Facilities includes rental costs for meeting rooms, public venues, sound equipment,  
projectors, or other items needed for a project. Grant funds cannot be used to purchase major  
equipment, but you can place a fair market value on its use and count cost share. Fair market value is  
based on the cost of renting similar equipment. Small equipment purchases are allowable, but  
purchase must be vital to the project and cannot exceed 25% of the overall grant request.  
Accessibility Costs assist with increasing access to the project: sign language interpreters, Spanish  
language interpreters, audio tours for digital and in-person exhibits, rental of accessible ramps, etc.  
Costs must be directly related to the grant project. (HK cannot fund projects that retroactively make  
existing humanities content accessible.)  
Indirect Costs can be added to the grant request to support the overhead costs of the project. The  
de minimis rate is 15% unless your organization has a federal Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate  
Agreement (NICRA). If 15% de minimis is not requested in the grant budget, HK will add it to cost  
share.  
Other includes costs essential to the project not identified above. Be specific. HK rarely funds  
“miscellaneous” costs. Items such as refreshments and group meals should be listed as cost share.  
19\. Additional Funding Sources. List additional funding that you have requested, plan to request, or  
have secured for this project. Provide amount(s) and funding source(s). \[1,500 characters\]  
20\. Admission. Are you charging admission for anything related to the project? Yes or No.  
AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL  
21\. Authorizing Official is the person, such as president, dean, or executive director, who is authorized  
to approve an application on the organization’s behalf.  
• Name and Title / Role in Organization  
ATTACHMENTS  
22\. Promotional Image: All applicants must upload a photograph or image related to the project that can  
be used in Humanities Kansas publications. Images of people and faces are preferred. Avoid logos.  
Historical photographs are acceptable. Images should be a maximum of 1 MB in size. (JPG, PNG,  
GIF, PDF)  
23\. Supplemental Attachments for Exhibitions, Media Projects, and/or Outdoor Signage.  
24\. Letters of Support for community-based projects are required if the sponsor organization is not a  
nonprofit within that community.  
For other projects, letters of support are not required, but can explain the broader community impact.  
Letters provided by a partner organization, mayor, or convention & visitors bureau help demonstrate  
local interest. No more than three letters of support. Combine letters into one file to upload.  
Documents should be a maximum of 1MB in size. (PDF or Word)  
25\. Required Attachments or Additional Material that has not been previously addressed, or additional  
scholars. Combine letters into one file to upload. Documents should be a maximum of 1MB in size.  
(PDF or Word)  
Acknowledgement of Humanities Kansas. All material developed with an HK grant, including  
associated publicity and promotional materials, shall include the HK logo and credit funding by  
Humanities Kansas. All projects must include a disclaimer statement to the effect that views expressed  
are not necessarily those of Humanities Kansas or the National Endowment for the Humanities.

**The budget summary is a fillable form that states cash and in-kind cost-share contributions, as well as grant amount requested from HumanitiesAR. The totals for each of these items should match and add up to what is written in the budget explanation.**

### Budget Explanation

**The budget explanation will include an itemized explanation of the totals listed in the budget summary, as well as a justification for the funds you’re requesting from HumanitiesAR.**

**When federal or state rates aren’t applicable, you must submit documentation to corroborate the amounts included in the budget. A few common examples of expenses that require documentation include supplies, books, printing, hotel rates, airfare, facility rentals, or contracted companies. The documentation should be itemized, accounting for items to be purchased, item price, and the number of items.**

### Cost Share

**Cost-sharing (or matching) means that a portion of a project’s cost is not funded by federal funds. For  Major and Mini Grants, cost-sharing is 50/50. This means HumanitiesAR grant funds may not account for more than half of the project’s total cost.**

* **You can use any combination of cash cost-share or in-kind cost-share, but all funds must be secured at the time of application.**  
* **Cost-share may include cash from applicant, in-kind, and cash from other sources. Those other sources may be private, corporate, or government awards and/or donations (local, state, and/or federal). Grants received from other entities for the same project may be used as cost-share, but may not be used for identical expenses of the project.**  
* **In-kind cost-share is the cash value of services, goods, and space donated to the project by third parties.**  
* **All cost-share and expenses for a project must occur during the proposed grant period. Applicants may use any combination of cash cost-share and in-kind cost-share to meet grant application requirements.**  
* **All cost-share, including registration fees, donations, grants, and funds, must be secured at the time of grant application submission.**  
* **Unsecured registration fees, grants, and donations may not be used for cost-share.**  
* **Grants that require cost-share:**  
  * **Major Grants**  
  * **Mini Grants**

### Examples of Common Expenses

* **Travel**  
  * **Mileage reimbursement**  
    * **Must include the person(s) name to receive reimbursement, the purpose of the trip, the from and to locations, total roundtrip miles, cost per mile (HumanitiesAR will pay up to the current government rate per mile), and total amount.**  
  * **Airfare**  
    * **Must include the from and to locations, the purpose of the trip, name of the traveler, and cost of airfare for each person to receive reimbursement.**  
  * **Hotel accommodations**

    * **Honoraria**  
      * **Organizations requesting funds for speaker fees and/or honoraria will be allowed up to a maximum of $1,000 per speaker. The fact that a speaker is widely recognized and considered to be important is not in and of itself justification for an increase in the honoraria for a single event. The total cost for multiple speakers will not exceed $5,000 per proposal.**  
* **Supplies and Materials**  
  * **Must include unit, unit cost, number of units, and shipping costs if applicable for each item**

Justification for the purchase or rental of equipment must accompany the grant application and be included in the Budget Narrative.**  
  * **The applicant must show that the purchase price is less than the rental price of the items for the length of the proposed grant period.**  
  * **The applicant should explain the plan for use of purchased equipment after the project is completed.**

### Sample Grant Budget Summary and Explanation

**In the fictional example—provided here for demonstration purposes only—the applicant, Ms. Suzie Teacher, is applying for a grant to host a professional development symposium in Little Rock. Suzie will bring in three speakers and supply their books to symposium attendees. She is requesting funds to pay honoraria to the speakers, reimburse mileage for their trips to Little Rock, and purchase the books to distribute at the event.**

**This example demonstrates how to fill out budget forms to satisfy our requirements. As a reminder, you must submit all budget summaries and explanations using our fillable PDF forms (seen in this example). If you don’t use these forms, you may be asked to resubmit with the proper paperwork or be denied due to noncompliance.**

**NOTE: This example includes the use of cost-share. If you’re applying for a grant that doesn’t have a cost-share requirement, you can still follow this same example but leave blank the “Cash from Applicant” and “In-Kind” sections.**

**GRANT REQUIREMENTS II: ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIRMENTS Cost share The amount and type of cost-sharing, or cost-matching, required for AHA-funded projects varies by grant. In general, the cost share consists of all project expenses not attributed directly to potential funding provided by AHA, including funding from the applicant’s own budget, cash raised from third-party sources, anticipated program income (such as admission fees), or in-kind contributions (donated time or services). All cash and in-kind contributions provided to a project by a grantee are acceptable as cost sharing when they meet the below criteria. They must be: • Verifiable from grantee’s records • Necessary and reasonable for the proper and efficient accomplishment of project objectives • Used to support activities that are included in the approved project narrative • Incurred during the grant period • Allowable under applicable federal cost share requirements When an applicant is not able to calculate the exact cost involved in contributing its own equipment, space, services, etc. to the project, then the applicant must indicate in the project budget the basis for determining the value of the contribution. Program income Program income is gross income that is earned or received by an awardee from the activities supported by award funds or from products resulting from award activities. It includes, but is not limited to, income from fees for services performed and from the sale of items produced under an award; usage or rental fees for equipment of property acquired under an award; admission fees; broadcast of distribution rights; and license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights. Program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. Awardees may use the program income that they generate during the award period to meet their cost-sharing requirements. Awardees may deduct the costs incident to the generation of program income — if these are not already charged to the award — to determine program income. AHA places no restrictions on the use of program income earned after the award period. AHA Grant Guidelines | Revised 5.19.25 1100 Ireland Way, Suite 202 | Birmingham, AL 35205 | alabamahumanities.org 9 Project Director AHA requires all applicants to name a Project Director who is responsible for managing and implementing the grant project. The Project Director should ensure compliance with the grant guidelines and terms of the grant agreement, and help prepare the narrative and financial portions of all reports. Financial Officer AHA requires applicants to name a Financial Officer to oversee all record-keeping and accounting of grant funds, matching contributions, and services received. The Financial Officer may not also serve as the Project Director. The Financial Officer is usually a qualified accountant or bookkeeper and may be from the applicant organization or a third party. The Financial Officer, in consultation with the Project Director, should help prepare the financial portion of all reports. Project evaluation AHA requires applicants to submit an evaluation plan that is appropriate for assessing the project’s identified goals. Evaluations are meant to gather the feedback necessary to improve future programming and may include audience surveys and questionnaires, independent evaluators, and evaluation consultants. Grant period The grant period encompasses both the period of performance and budget period for each grant award. All project activities must be completed within the grant period and all project costs attributed to the award, including the applicant’s cost share match, must be incurred within the grant period. Applicants request their own grant period start and end dates based on their project timeline. The grant period may begin after a required waiting period that allows AHA to review applications and begin the administrative requirements of grant awards. The waiting period begins on the final application deadline and lasts 45 days for Mini Grants, 60 days for Major Grants, and 90 days for Media Grants. The grant period may remain open for up to two years. Repeat funding AHA will not fund multiple grants with overlapping grant periods to the same organization, and AHA will not fund the same project through awards to multiple organizations. AHA Grant Guidelines | Revised 5.19.25 1100 Ireland Way, Suite 202 | Birmingham, AL 35205 | alabamahumanities.org 10 For colleges and universities, AHA considers each academic department or affiliate as a separate organization when considering repeat funding. For municipalities, library systems, and other large institutions with multiple locations or affiliates, AHA may consider each affiliate as a separate organization when considering repeat funding. In the case of annual programs or long-term projects, AHA will only fund the same program or project for three consecutive years. After the third year, organizations must sit out one calendar year before reapplying for the same project. When sitting out a year, applicants may apply for funding for a different project. AHA will consider an organization’s past award activity as an example of the organization’s capacity to plan, execute, and administer successful projects. AHA will also consider and evaluate each application on its individual merits and does not guarantee repeat funding. Post-award responsibilities Grantees much remain in compliance with AHA guidelines over the course of their funded projects. Grantees are also expected to recognize AHA’s support in any promotional materials about their project; a media toolkit is available from AHA for this purpose. Applicants may contact AHA for sample copies of grant agreements and other resources related to post-award responsibilities, such as reporting requirements, financial management standards, acknowledgment of support, and compliance with applicable federal laws. AHA Grant Guidelines | Revised 11.4.24 1100 Ireland Way, Suite 202 | Birmingham, AL 35205 | alabamahumanities.org GRANT REQUIREMENTS III: BUDGET REQUIREMENTS AHA requires all applicants to submit a project budget using AHA’s budget narrative template supplied on all application and reporting forms. The applicant’s budget should illustrate how the applicant will spend AHA funding and the estimated cost share match, including cash and in-kind support from both the applicant and thirdparty sources. All project costs must be reasonable, necessary to accomplish project objectives, and incurred during the grant period. Costs should be valued in relation to rates paid for similar work, current market prices, or fair rental charges. Grantees must follow standard accounting procedures for all grant awards. An organized and thorough budget bolsters a proposal and instills confidence in AHA’s reviewers that the applicant has the capacity to complete the project successfully. The line items included in the budget should be well-researched and organized into the following categories: 1\. Administration AHA does not directly fund administrative expenses, but applicants may apply direct administrative costs to their cost share match. Such expenses often include salaries, including fringe benefits, for personnel such as the Project Director, Financial Officer, and other personnel employed by the applicant who are directly involved in project management. Applicants may include volunteer services as cost shares if the service is an integral and necessary part of the project. Volunteer services should be calculated at a rate paid for similar work by the organization or by other employers in the same labor market. 2\. Honoraria Honoraria includes payments to humanities scholars, professionals, and other resource personnel directly involved in the project. Expenses for salaried employees of the applicant’s organization are not eligible for AHA funding and should be included as cost share match, except in the case of salaries and fees for production staff involved in media grants. Applicants may employ interns, students, or similar positions for project activities if individuals are not receiving academic credit for their work. AHA Grant Guidelines | Revised 11.4.24 1100 Ireland Way, Suite 202 | Birmingham, AL 35205 | alabamahumanities.org 3\. Travel Applicants may request travel expenses for transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items for travel costs that are necessary, reasonable, and directly attributable to specific project work. These costs may be charged on an actual cost basis, on a per diem or mileage basis, or on a combination of the two, based on the organization’s established travel policies. Necessary airfare must be undertaken on U.S. flag air carriers at the customary standard commercial airfare (coach or equivalent), the federal government contract airfare, or the lowest commercial discount airfare unless otherwise approved. AHA does not fund international travel. 4\. Supplies Applicants may request funding for supplies based on the cost of purchased items. AHA regularly funds consumable supplies such as office materials or resources that the applicant will give away to program participants to increase participation, including copies of books. AHA does not fund costs for promotional items and memorabilia, such as gift bags, t-shirts, and souvenirs.
